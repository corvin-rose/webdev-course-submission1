# WebDev Submission 1

This is a submission for my Web Developement Course at HTW-Berlin.

<strong>Task:</strong> Create a Single Page Application with an Admin and Staff area. Both should have a login form and should be editable (add, update, delete). This task must be implemented only in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

<br/>

## General Information:
To start open login.html in the website folder. Enter the following login credentials:
```
User: Admin
Password: Admin
```
Keep in mind, that this application runs without any backend, so some features are hardcoded and will be changed in the future. This is a demonstration for CSS and Javascript only.
